# HyperCard Notes

Sketching why Apple's stack of cards still shapes how I think about software.

## The stack as a canvas

HyperCard let non-programmers build software by stacking cards, drawing buttons, and sprinkling just enough HyperTalk to stitch ideas together. That gradient between writing and programming still feels unmatched.

## Lessons worth stealing

1. **Content first** — Start with the cards, add logic later.
2. **Visible affordances** — Every button looked tappable.
3. **Shareable artifacts** — Give people a single file they can remix.

## Where it shows up now

- Notion pages with buttons
- Low-code dashboards
- Personal knowledge bases

I'm tempted to recreate a stack in modern HTML just to remember how liberating that canvas felt.
